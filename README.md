## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Zero, a computer enthusiast who is interested in learning programming!
I am a 20 year old male who loves video games, music, art, military equipment, photography, and computer science.

For the most part I'm self-taught, using online resources that are free, as well as running Linux systems on my computer. Currently, I am dual booting Linux Mint and Void Linux, Void is my main system, while Mint is a host system for my upcoming project.

My upcoming project is going to be a Linux From Scratch setup on my secondary SSD, I am going to log it in a repository so that you all can see my progress. The system I build is probably never going to leave my PC, but honestly that isn't something I'm worried about. It is mainly just to familiarize myself with the Linux kernel. I wouldn't mind feedback though once I get it up and running. 

Anyways, I will stop yapping as I don't want to keep you all here forever. It is nice to see everyone and I can't wait to share my progress with you all.

Cheers - Zero Ryftwalker
